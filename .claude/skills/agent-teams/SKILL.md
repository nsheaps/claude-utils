# Claude Code Agent Teams

Agent teams orchestrate multiple independent Claude Code sessions working in parallel. One session acts as the "lead" that spawns and coordinates "teammates" -- each a full Claude Code instance with its own context window.

**Status**: Experimental (released February 2026 with Opus 4.6)

## Enabling Agent Teams

Set `CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS` to `1` in environment or settings.json:

```json
{
  "env": {
    "CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS": "1"
  }
}
```

Or via the `claude-team` / `ct` helper scripts from claude-utils:

```bash
claude-team                    # Interactive mode picker
ct --mode tmux                 # Direct tmux mode
```

## Teammate Display Modes

| Mode | Description | Requirements |
|:-----|:------------|:-------------|
| `auto` | Auto-detect best backend | Default |
| `in-process` | Hidden sessions, Shift+Up/Down to switch | None |
| `tmux` | Visible split panes, survives leader exit | tmux or iTerm2 + `it2` CLI |

Configure in `settings.json` or per-session:

```json
{ "teammateMode": "in-process" }
```

```bash
claude --teammate-mode tmux
```

### tmux -CC and iTerm2 Integration

The `"tmux"` setting uses tmux as the backend in **all cases** -- including when iTerm2 is the terminal. The difference is presentation:

| Scenario | What Happens |
|:---------|:-------------|
| Inside tmux session | Standard tmux split panes (green status bar, prefix keys) |
| iTerm2 (not in tmux) | `tmux -CC` control mode -- teammates appear as native iTerm2 tabs/panes |
| Other terminal | Falls back to in-process mode |

**tmux -CC (control mode)** is a text-based protocol where tmux sends structured messages instead of rendering a terminal UI. iTerm2 intercepts these and renders native macOS windows/tabs. Benefits over raw tmux:
- Native trackpad scrolling, Cmd+C/V, Cmd+F search
- Click-to-interact with teammate panes
- No tmux keybinding learning curve
- Session persistence (tmux keeps running if iTerm2 quits; reconnect with `tmux -CC attach`)

The `claude-team` helper auto-launches `tmux -CC` when tmux mode is selected outside a tmux session, so users don't need to manually start tmux first.

## Creating a Team

Describe the task and team structure in natural language. Claude will propose the team composition and wait for approval before proceeding.

## Keyboard Controls

| Control | Function |
|:--------|:---------|
| Shift+Up/Down | Cycle through teammates (in-process) |
| Ctrl+T | Toggle task list |
| Ctrl+O | Toggle verbose view (shows full inter-agent messages instead of summaries) |
| Shift+Tab | Toggle delegate mode (lead coordination only) |
| Escape | Interrupt teammate's turn |

## Core Architecture

Seven internal primitives power the system:

1. **TeamCreate** -- Initialize team namespace and config
2. **TaskCreate** -- Define discrete work units
3. **TaskUpdate** -- Claim tasks, update status
4. **TaskList** -- List available work for self-claiming
5. **Task (with team_name)** -- Spawn a teammate session
6. **SendMessage** -- Peer-to-peer communication between any teammates
7. **TeamDelete** -- Clean up team resources

## Communication

Teammates communicate via a shared mailbox system with direct peer-to-peer messaging. Message types include: `message`, `broadcast`, `shutdown_request/response`, `idle_notification`, `task_completed`, `plan_approval_request/response`.

The shared task list supports dependency tracking with automatic unblocking. File locking prevents race conditions on task claiming.

## Environment Variables (Set Automatically for Teammates)

| Variable | Description |
|:---------|:------------|
| `CLAUDE_CODE_TEAM_NAME` | Team name |
| `CLAUDE_CODE_AGENT_ID` | Unique agent ID |
| `CLAUDE_CODE_AGENT_NAME` | Display name |
| `CLAUDE_CODE_AGENT_TYPE` | Agent type |
| `CLAUDE_CODE_PLAN_MODE_REQUIRED` | Whether plan approval is required |
| `CLAUDE_CODE_PARENT_SESSION_ID` | Parent session ID |

## File Storage

```
~/.claude/teams/{team-name}/
  config.json            # Team metadata, members array
  inboxes/{agent}.json   # Per-agent message inbox

~/.claude/tasks/{team-name}/
  1.json, 2.json, ...    # Individual task files
```

## Team Hooks

### TeammateIdle

Fires when a teammate finishes its turn. Exit code 2 sends stderr as feedback and keeps the teammate working. Does not support matchers or prompt-based hooks.

### TaskCompleted

Fires when a task is marked complete (via TaskUpdate or when a teammate finishes with in-progress tasks). Exit code 2 prevents completion and sends stderr as feedback.

For working examples and hook configuration patterns, consult `references/hooks-and-config.md`.

## Best Practices

1. **Give teammates enough context** in spawn prompts -- conversation history does not carry over
2. **Size 5-6 tasks per teammate** -- the optimal sweet spot
3. **Avoid same-file edits** -- break work so each teammate owns different files
4. **Use delegate mode** (Shift+Tab) for complex orchestration
5. **Require plan approval** for risky or architectural work
6. **Use meaningful agent names** -- `security-reviewer` beats `worker-1`
7. **Pre-approve common operations** to reduce permission prompt interruptions

## When to Use vs Avoid

**Strong use cases**: Research/review, independent modules, debugging with competing hypotheses, cross-layer coordination, parallel code review.

**Avoid for**: Sequential dependent tasks, same-file edits, simple/routine tasks, cost-sensitive work (~7x token usage).

## Limitations

- No session resumption for in-process teammates
- One team per session; clean up before starting a new one
- No nested teams (teammates cannot spawn their own teams)
- Lead is fixed for the session's lifetime
- Split panes require tmux or iTerm2 (`claude-team` auto-launches `tmux -CC` if needed)
- Teammates start with lead's permission mode
