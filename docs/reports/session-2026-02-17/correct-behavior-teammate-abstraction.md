# Behavior Correction: Teammate Abstraction

- **File**: `/Users/nathan.heaps/src/nsheaps/ai-mktpl/.ai/rules/teammate-abstraction.md`
- **Commit**: `e68f6bf12d655b628bb7fa3795cd72067a86c250`
- **Summary**: Added rule that teammates are black boxes. When reporting status, say "[Name] is working on [task]" — never mention sub-agents, background agents, internal delegation, or other implementation details of how a teammate accomplishes work.
