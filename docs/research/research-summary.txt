RESEARCH SCOPE:
1. tmux Orchestration Layers for Claude Code (beyond basic usage)
2. Linear Hooks/Integrations for Agent Team Coordination

KEY FINDINGS:

TOPIC 1: tmux Orchestration
- 10 active community projects mapping tmux → AI agent orchestration
- Three architectural patterns: Named Sessions, Web Dashboards, IDE Control Planes
- Session persistence solves SSH/terminal crash issues
- Named Tmux Manager (NTM) is production Go implementation
- Agent Viewer provides web kanban interface
- Warp/Oz emerging as cloud orchestration platform

TOPIC 2: Linear + Agents
- Linear MCP server: 32+ tools, OAuth+API key auth, centrally hosted
- Linear Agent API: Create agents as workspace users, delegate issues
- Webhooks: Real-time event triggers (Issues, Comments, Projects, etc)
- Cursor integration: Live and functional, auto-creates PRs
- Gartner prediction: 40% of enterprise apps will have task-specific agents by 2026

INTEGRATION OPPORTUNITIES:
- Pattern 1: Issue-driven spawning (webhook → orchestrator → teammates)
- Pattern 2: Self-coordination via Linear comments
- Pattern 3: User interception with Linear context refresh
- Key insight: tmux = execution layer, Linear = coordination layer

TOOLS CATALOGED:
tmux Side:
  - Named Tmux Manager (Go)
  - Agent of Empires (Rust)
  - Agent Viewer (Node.js)
  - KanVibe (Rust)
  - tmux-agents (TypeScript)
  - 5 more variants

Linear Side:
  - Official MCP Server
  - Official Agent API
  - Official Webhooks
  - 2 Community MCP implementations
  - Cursor integration

CONFIDENCE LEVELS:
High: tmux is de facto standard, Linear MCP production-ready
Medium: Long-term stability of community tools, MCP as universal standard
Low: Custom Linear agent development examples, Warp/Oz patterns

NEXT STEPS FOR claude-utils:
1. Consider Linear MCP integration in orchestrator
2. Webhook handlers for issue-driven spawning
3. Status update flow back to Linear
4. Document integration patterns in skills

SOURCES: 30+ articles, 15+ GitHub repos, official Linear/Claude documentation
